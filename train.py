TODO:

1. import stuff
2. Load augmented data from dataloader
3. Set all functions and constants (loss func, optimizer func, epochs, folders, device etc)
4. Define the model
5. Build a training loop
    1. Move to GPU
    2. Define the training function
    3. Calculate the running loss and store the same in list and later convert to np array and save the np array.
    4. Calculate the accuracy after every batch. Calculate the average of same and store the values in a list 
       and later convert it to np array and save theh np array.
    5. After every epoch, test the model loss and accuracy 
       (by following the same steps as done for training ie, move to list, convert to np array, save the np array) with the test data.
